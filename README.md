# Time Series Forecasting Hybrid Model

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on time series forecasting using the M4 competition dataset. Time series forecasting is the process of using historical data to predict future values of a continuous sequence of data points, measured at regular intervals. This technique is widely used in various fields such as finance, economics, weather forecasting, and supply chain management.

## Project Overview

The goal of time series forecasting is to identify patterns and trends in data to make accurate predictions about future events. There are three primary approaches to time series forecasting:

1. **Heuristic Models**
2. **Statistical Models**
3. **Neural Network Models**

Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the forecasting problem. In this project, we focus on developing a hybrid model that combines the best-performing models from each approach to create a robust and accurate forecasting system.

### M4 Dataset

The M4 dataset used in this project consists of 100,000-time series, each with unique characteristics, providing a challenging and diverse testbed for evaluating the performance of different forecasting models. Our primary focus is on the hourly time series from the M4 competition dataset, a widely recognized benchmark in the field.

### Evaluation Metrics

To assess the performance of each model, we utilize the following metrics:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE)**

### Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop a hybrid model that outperforms individual models by combining their strengths, resulting in more accurate and reliable forecasts. Accurate time series forecasting is crucial for:

- Business decision-making
- Resource allocation
- Strategic planning
- Demand forecasting
- Inventory and supply chain management
- Risk mitigation
- Optimizing resource allocation and budgeting
